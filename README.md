# Implementation-of-Axis-Based-Virtual-Co-ordinate-Assignment-Technique-for-Guaranteed-Routing
In this project, I have implemented an algorithm for constructing a Virtual Coordinate System which is devoid of any location information. The Axis based virtual assignment (ABVCAP) technique assigns a unique 5 tuple VC to each of the nodes and guarantees successful packet delivery in the network.
