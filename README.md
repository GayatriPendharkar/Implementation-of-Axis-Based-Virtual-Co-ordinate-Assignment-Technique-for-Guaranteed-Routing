# Implementation-of-Axis-Based-Virtual-Co-ordinate-Assignment-Technique-for-Guaranteed-Routing

Dataset of sample 19 ndoes:

1. Run the file ABVCAP_19_nodes.py

2. It will prompt you to enter the value of the sink node W. Enter any desired node number you want the sink node to be at.

3. Once entered, a simulation of the establishment of axes 'parallel of latitude' and 'Meridians' will be plotted.

4. The Virtual coordinates for Longitude, Latitude and Ripple (n.lo, n.la, n.ripple) will be written to a File VirtualCoordinates.txt.






Any network topology with randomly placed nodes:

1. Run the file ABVCAP.py

2. Consider any kind of network you want to implement the algorithm on. 

3. Ensure to put the text file with its physical coordinates at the location where your .py file is present.

4. It will prompt you to enter the value of the sink node W. Enter any desired node number you want the sink node to be at.

5. Once entered, a simulation of the establishment of axes 'parallel of latitude' and 'Meridians' will be plotted.
